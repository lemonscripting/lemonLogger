## Description
Lemon Logger is a lightweight JavaScript library for logging user data to Firebase Firestore. It provides an easy way to collect basic and advanced user information and store it securely in a Firebase databaseüîß

## Instructions

### Configuration
Before using Lemon Logger, you need to set up your Firebase configuration. Follow these steps:

1. Create a Firebase project on the Firebase Console.
2. Navigate to your project settings and find your Firebase configuration object.
3. Save your Firebase configuration object in a file named config.js under the /data directory in your project.

Example Firebase configuration object (in `/data/config.js`):
```javascript
// data/config.js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
  measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
};
```

### Usage
To use Lemon Logger in your project, simply include the following script tag with the `defer` attribute in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/lemonscripting/lemonLogger/<version>.js" defer></script>
```

Once you have included the Lemon Logger script and set up your Firebase configuration, Lemon Logger will automatically start collecting user data and logging it to your Firebase Firestore database.
